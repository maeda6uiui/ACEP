**Analysis of Compromised Emails and Passwords**

## Overview

This repository is going to work as a reservoir of analysis results obtained from combolists, lists that enumerate email addresses and their corresponding passwords (plain text or hash).

If you are interested if your email address is in a data breach, use [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) or similar services.

## Comment

I assume that combolists are formatted like `<email><delimiter><password or hash>`, although some combolists apparently have `<password or hash><delimiter><email>` or `<email>` or some sort of garbage (at least for me without any profound knowledge...).

Note that analysis results may not be accurate because of my humble processing.
