**Analysis of Compromised Emails and Passwords**

## Overview

This repository is going to work as a reservoir of analysis results obtained from combolists, lists that enumerate email addresses and their corresponding passwords (plain text or hash).

If you are interested if your email address is in a data breach, use [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) or similar services.
